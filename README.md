# Let's Understand GitHub

## 📌 What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform for **version control** and **collaboration**. It allows developers to store, manage, and share their code using **Git**, a version control system created by **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux).  

With GitHub, developers can:
- ✅ Track changes in their code over time  
- ✅ Work on projects with multiple people  
- ✅ Create branches for new features and merge them later  
- ✅ Store and deploy open-source or private projects

## 🔍 The Story of GitHub’s Creation

### 🏗 How and Why Was GitHub Created?
- Before GitHub, developers used centralized version control systems like **Subversion (SVN)** or **Perforce**, which were not ideal for distributed teams.  
- In **2005**, Linus Torvalds created **Git**, a **decentralized** version control system, for managing the Linux kernel.  
- In **2008**, **Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Scott Chacon** founded **GitHub**, making Git easier to use through a **web-based interface**.  
- GitHub quickly became popular because it simplified collaboration and hosting open-source projects.  

In **2018**, **Microsoft acquired GitHub** for **$7.5 billion**, which led to debates about whether GitHub would remain independent, but it continues to support open-source development.

## 🏢 Why Do Companies Use GitHub?
Big companies like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon** use GitHub because:
- ✅ **Collaboration** – Teams can work together on the same codebase.
- ✅ **Version Control** – Tracks all changes, preventing code loss.
- ✅ **CI/CD Integration** – Automates testing and deployment.
- ✅ **Security & Backup** – Protects code from being lost.
- ✅ **Open-Source Contributions** – Companies can contribute to and benefit from the open-source community.
- ✅ **Private Repositories** – Companies can store confidential projects securely.

Some companies use **GitHub Enterprise**, a self-hosted version of GitHub for extra security.

## ❓ Is It Risky to Push Big Projects on GitHub?
It depends on **how you use it**:

🔹 **Public Repositories** → Your code is **open to everyone**. If you’re working on a **sensitive project**, don’t push it to a public repo.  
🔹 **Private Repositories** → Only you and authorized collaborators can access it.  
🔹 **GitHub Terms of Service** → GitHub **does NOT own your code**. Your projects remain **yours** unless you publish them under an open-source license.  
🔹 **Security Risks** → If you accidentally push sensitive data (like API keys), anyone can see it in a public repo.  

### 🔐 Best Practices to Protect Your Code:
- ✅ Use **private repositories** for sensitive projects.
- ✅ Never push **API keys, passwords, or sensitive data**.
- ✅ Enable **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** for security.
- ✅ Use **GitHub Advanced Security** to scan for vulnerabilities.
